Federated learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained across multiple devices or servers while keeping the data localized. This approach is beneficial for scenarios where data privacy is crucial, and transferring data to a central server is not feasible.\n\nHowever, federated learning is susceptible to attacks, especially when malicious devices introduce noisy or poisoned data. In this demonstration, we will simulate such an attack and then introduce a defense mechanism to mitigate its effects.\n\nLet's begin by setting up the necessary libraries and defining our simple linear regression model.",

This dataset contains ten baseline variables like age, sex, BMI, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements for 442 diabetes patients. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.\n\n2. **Data Standardization**: We standardize the dataset using the `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`. Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators. They might behave badly if the individual features do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data (e.g., Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).\n\n3. **Simulate Data on Different Devices**: We split the dataset into chunks to simulate the scenario where data is distributed across different devices. Each device gets a subset of the data. This is a common scenario in federated learning where each device (e.g., mobile phones) has its local data and doesn't share it directly due to privacy concerns.\n\n4. **Initialize a Global Model**: We create an instance of our `LinearRegression` class, which will act as our global model.\n\n5. **Evaluate Model Before Training**: Before starting the federated learning process, we evaluate the model's performance on all data using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. This gives us a baseline to compare against after training.\n\n6. **Federated Learning**: We then perform federated learning using the `federated_learning` function. After training, we evaluate the model's performance again to see the improvement.\n\nThe outputs show the model's MSE before and after federated learning. Next, we'll introduce an adversarial attack by adding a device with noisy data and observe its impact on the model.",

This device will contain data that has been intentionally corrupted or poisoned.\n\n2. **Generate Noisy Data**: For this device, we add significant noise to the features (`X_noisy`) and targets (`y_noisy`). This noise is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviations of 5 for features and 100 for targets. This simulates a scenario where an adversary might try to sabotage the federated learning process by introducing corrupted data.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the Model with Noisy Data**: We then perform federated learning again, this time including the noisy data from the fifth device.\n\n4. **Evaluate Model's Metrics After Poisoning**: After training with the noisy data, we evaluate the model's performance using the MSE metric. This will help us understand the impact of the adversarial attack on the model's performance.\n\nThe output shows the model's MSE after the adversarial attack.

This value is higher than the initial MSE, suggesting that the model's performance was negatively impacted by the introduction of adversarial data.\n   - The averaged federated learning approach, which uses trust scores to weigh the contributions of each device, proves to be robust against data poisoning attacks. By adjusting trust scores based on the magnitude of updates from each device, the approach can identify and mitigate the impact of malicious devices.\n   - When re-instantiated, the initial model had an MSE of `28427.9`, and after the first round of averaged federated learning the model's MSE was `26383.7`. These are very similar results to the first time through.\n   - However, when the model was poisoned but trained using the trust system present in the averaged federated learning approach, the MSE was `23259.9`. This is the ***lowest MSE of all***.\n   - This suggests that this approach is not only resilient to this type of poisoning attack but also augments the model's learning proficiency beyond its pre-poisoning capabilities.\n   - In conclusion, the averaged federated learning approach provides a promising defense mechanism against data poisoning attacks in federated learning scenarios.",
